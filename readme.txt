the folder is used for training/validating k medoid models

we just use multi source as an example here

first unzip the zipped files and run k_medoid

and then run pca_model_for_centers to create pca for compressing returned 2d matrix barycenters to 1d vector

some of the result files like npy and pkl are already in the folder

you can put the results elsewhere in case being overwritten when testing the code
